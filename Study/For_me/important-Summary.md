## **Monolithic And Microservice**

## 1-Monolithic:

#####  :large_orange_diamond:It is a large system that  includes all the data of various application programs  and links  them together as one unit.

#### *IT's Flaws:*

- Hard to maintain .

- Complicated
- It depends on  the database, (meaning that if a corruption occurs in the database, the entire system is damaged) .

## 2-Microservice:

##### :large_orange_diamond: It is  a group of small systems separated from each other .

#### *IT'S  Features :*

- Easy to  maintain .
- Don't rely on the database, as it is separate from it
